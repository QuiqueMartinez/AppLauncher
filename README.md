# AppLauncher(Mock)

A clean WPF application prototype built with **.NET 9**, implementing a modern, maintainable architecture using:

- **MVVM pattern** (via [CommunityToolkit.MVVM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Mvvm/))
- **Native Dependency Injection** (via [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/))
- **Clear separation of responsibilities** between Views, ViewModels, Services, and Models

---

This project serves both as:

- A working prototype.
- A reference architecture for **modern WPF applications** built with clean MVVM + DI principles.

âž¡ This project only displays a project structure in WPF and is not functional!!. 

**Easy to replace mock services with real implementations as the project evolves.**
